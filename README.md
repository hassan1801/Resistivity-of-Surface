# Resistivity in 3D Topological Insulator
In an electron system where Dirac fermions exist, such as the surface of a 3D topological insulator where conduction states exist, we can use the size and number of magnetic impurity clusters to calculate resistance.
Here, we have considered the Ising interaction between the magnetic impurities and calculated the size and number behavior of the system based on different temperatures.
